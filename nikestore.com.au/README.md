Works on three types of pages:
1. On the launch calendar page (http://www.nikestore.com.au/get-help/products/product-launch-calendar). Checks for the pre-defined item name (e.g. "Air Jordan 4 Retro"), if released, click on the link, or if not yet, refresh this page.
2. On the cart page (http://www.nikestore.com.au/checkout/cart/'). Clicks the "Proceed to Checkout" button.
3. On item pages. Adds an item of pre-defined size to cart, and go to cart checkout page. Raises an alert if size not found or not availabel.
